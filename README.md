# Airbnb Price Prediction
Note: Due to the lack of data in the dataset, it was difficult for me to push the accuracy of my model beyond the 55-60% range. 

# Skills Used 
- Used Pandas to clean the dataset and preparing it for model training. 
- Used KMeans to cluster locations together and find patterns within those location clusters (using `latitude` and `longitude` data points).
- Used `XGBRegressor` as my model and fine tuned it for optimal results.
- Normamized all of my data using `numpy` for accurate results.
